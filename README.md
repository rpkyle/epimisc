# epimisc
Miscellaneous tools for epidemiological analyses. Originally assembled in 2015 for a course I helped TA, uploaded to GitHub by request. I didn't write most of these functions, but I wanted to make it easier for the students to use them. Please feel free to contact me (ryan.kyle@mail.mcgill.ca) with questions, concerns, or suggestions. 

The epimisc package, like R, is free software and comes with absolutely no warranty. This is a fancy way of saying that the functions have only been used/tested by two (small) cohorts of graduate students; your feedback is appreciated.
